# Nebari Provenance Collector Pack Documentation

This directory contains the [Docusaurus 3.5.2](https://docusaurus.io/) site for the Nebari Provenance Collector pack.

> **Note:** The site is currently an empty scaffold with a placeholder landing page. Section content will be added in follow-on work.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>= 18` (enforced by the `engines` field in `package.json`).
- Yarn (Classic, v1.22.x). Install globally with `npm install -g yarn`, then verify with `yarn --version`.

The site is built and tested against Node 20 and Yarn 1.22.22.

## Install

```bash
cd docs
yarn install
```

## Local development

```bash
yarn start
```

Starts the Docusaurus dev server with hot reload on http://localhost:3000/.

Note: the lunr search index is generated only by `yarn build`. The search box in the dev server will return no results; use a production build to exercise search.

## Production build

```bash
yarn build
```

Emits static files to `docs/build/`. The build step also produces the lunr search index via `docusaurus-lunr-search`.

## Preview the production build

```bash
yarn run serve
```

Serves the contents of `docs/build/` locally so you can verify the production output, including search.

## Troubleshooting

### `ValidationError: Invalid options object. Progress Plugin has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema`

This is a webpack-version mismatch. Docusaurus 3.5.2 targets webpack 5.94; webpack 5.97+ tightens the `ProgressPlugin` options schema and rejects what Docusaurus passes. `package.json` pins the resolution with:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "webpack": "5.94.0"
}
```

Yarn applies `resolutions` on install, but if `node_modules` was populated before the field existed (or by a different package manager) the wrong webpack stays cached. Reinstall cleanly:

```bash
cd docs
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) whenever changes land on the `main` branch. Configuration lives in [`netlify.toml`](../netlify.toml) at the repository root:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Base directory | `docs/` |
| Build command | `yarn run build` |
| Publish directory | `build/` (resolved to `docs/build/`) |
| Node version | `20` |
| Yarn version | `1.22.22` |

Pull requests get an automatic Netlify deploy preview, so reviewers can browse the rendered site before merging. No manual deploy step is required; if you need to trigger a rebuild without a code change, do it from the Netlify dashboard.

To point the site at a custom domain, update `url` in [`docusaurus.config.js`](./docusaurus.config.js) and configure the domain in Netlify. The current default, `https://nebari-provenance-collector-pack.netlify.app`, matches the Netlify-generated subdomain.
